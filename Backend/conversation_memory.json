      "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, we know that the INSAT-3D satellite has a 2-channel Sea Surface Temperature Monitor (SSTM) which is used to measure ocean temperature.  The exact workings of the SSTM aren't detailed in this document, but we know it's one of three instruments on INSAT-3D that simultaneously measure ocean parameters.  The other two are an Ocean Colour Monitor and a Scatterometer, which likely provide additional data to help refine the SST measurements.\n\nUnfortunately, the prov"

The documentation highlights that MOSDAC acts as a \"Storehouse for Space based Weather and Ocean Data,\" providing \"Near Real time Meteorological and Oceanographic data dissemination.\"  This suggests that MOSDAC plays a crucial role in making satellite data readily available to those who use it for forecasting, such as meteorological agencies and re"

The documentation mentions this study showed that spectral information is more important than angular information for computing broadband LSA over India.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided text doesn't give a complete description of INSAT-3D's purpose or the details of its capabilities.

The documentation mentions using both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in a \"staggering mode\" for deriving Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs), suggesting a slight difference in data acquisition or processing methodology between INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR (possibly relating to the 'R' signifying a revised or improved version).
